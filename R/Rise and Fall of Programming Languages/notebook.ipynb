Data on tags over time\n<p>How can we tell what programming languages and technologies are used by the most people? How about what languages are growing and which are shrinking, so that we can tell which are most worth investing time in?</p>\n<p>One excellent source of data is <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a>, a programming question and answer site with more than 16 million questions on programming topics. By measuring the number of questions about each technology, we can get an approximate sense of how many people are using it. We're going to use open data from the <a href=\"https://data.stackexchange.com/\">Stack Exchange Data Explorer</a> to examine the relative popularity of languages like R, Python, Java and Javascript have changed over time.</p>\n<p>Each Stack Overflow question has a <strong>tag</strong>, which marks a question to describe its topic or technology. For instance, there's a tag for languages like <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/r\">R</a> or <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/python\">Python</a>, and for packages like <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2\">ggplot2</a> or <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas\">pandas</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/project_435/img/tags.png\" alt=\"Stack Overflow tags\"></p>\n<p>We'll be working with a dataset with one observation for each tag in each year.
